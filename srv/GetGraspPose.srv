# Response
# NOTE:
# Grasp does not have any specified frame (really should have a PoseStamped).
# As a result, all sorts of dirtiness ensues (the BT wrapping Doug's service
# has to manually TF into base_link, & we generally assume everything else is
# in base_link). This is arbitrary, inconsistent, & may well burn us at some
# point. It should be fixed & made consistent...
